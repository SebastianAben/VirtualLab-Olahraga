    title: 'Excellent Control!',
    feedback:
      'You demonstrated exceptional control over your heart rate, keeping it consistently within the target zone. This is the hallmark of a well-conditioned cardiovascular system.',
    improvement:
      'This is a top-tier result. To challenge yourself further, try a longer duration or a challenge that requires switching between different zones more rapidly.',
    impact:
      'Excellent cardiovascular control is linked to a lower resting heart rate, better stress management, and significantly reduced risk of heart disease. Your heart is efficient and recovers quickly.',
  },
  B: {
    title: 'Great Performance!',
    feedback:
      'You did a great job, spending most of your time in the target zone. Your heart rate fluctuated slightly, which is very common.',
    improvement:
      'Focus on anticipating the effort needed. Try to make smoother transitions when you feel your heart rate drifting. Consistent practice will turn this B into an A.',
    impact:
      'This is a very healthy result. Your heart is responding well to exercise. Improving consistency will enhance your stamina and make sustained effort feel easier.',
  },
  C: {
    title: 'Good Effort!',
    feedback:
      'A solid performance. You were able to hold your heart rate in the target zone for a good portion of the time, but there were several fluctuations.',
    improvement:
      'Try to focus on maintaining a steady breathing rhythm. Uncontrolled breathing can cause your heart rate to spike or dip. Also, ensure you are not over-exerting at the start.',
    impact:
      'This is an average and healthy response to exercise. With more practice, your body will learn to regulate its heart rate more efficiently, leading to better endurance and overall fitness.',
  },
  D: {
    title: 'You Can Do It!',
    feedback:
      'You completed the challenge, but your heart rate was often outside the target zone. This usually means you were either pushing too hard or easing off too much.',
    improvement:
      'Let\'s focus on consistency. Try a lower intensity challenge first to get a feel for control. The goal isn\'t just to get the heart rate up, but to hold it steady.',
    impact:
      'An inconsistent heart rate response can mean your body is working harder than it needs to. This can lead to faster fatigue. Improving control will make exercise feel less strenuous and more effective.',
  },
  F: {
    title: 'A Good Start!',
    feedback:
      'You struggled to keep your heart rate in the zone for the required duration. This is a common starting point and a great opportunity for improvement.',
    improvement:
      'Don\'t be discouraged! The first step is awareness. Try the challenge again, but this time, pay very close attention to the graph and make small, frequent adjustments to your perceived effort.',
    impact:
      'Difficulty in controlling heart rate during exercise can be a sign of deconditioning. Consistent practice, even starting with light intensity like walking, will rapidly improve this control and your overall health.',
